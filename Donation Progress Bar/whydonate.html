5 Reasons Why You Should Make Charitable Donations
</h1>

<h2>Paying It Forward! </h2>
<p>Taking some of what you have and giving to those less fortunate is a great way to pay it forward and give back to your community. We should all be grateful for what we have and take notice of those around us who are lacking. It can often time be even the smallest things we give that can make the biggest change in the lives of others.</p>
<h2>Setting an example</h2>

<p> Charitable giving is a great way to set an example for your children, co-workers, family and friends. Be a leader and let those in your circle follow in your footsteps and find motivation through your acts of goodwill to do the same.</p>

<h2>Spreading Love!</h2>
<p>  Love is something the world and everyone in it needs. By giving to charity, you can spread love in many ways. You can do so by making a donation in memory of a loved one who passed away as a tribute or for a loved one who is still with you and a supporter of a particular cause by making a donation in their name.</p>
<h2>Making the world a better place!</h2>
<p>Through every donation made, someone benefits from that donation and it causes a ripple of positivity that can transform someoneâ€™s life. Through those acts of charitable giving, it makes the world a better place as those in need begin to possess a new outlook on life.</p>
<h2>Gaining respect and leaving a legacy!</h2>

<p>When you give to others, those around you will have a deeper respect and appreciation for you. You will be building a legacy to leave behind wherein others will remember you for the differences you made in the lives of others through your charitable giving.
